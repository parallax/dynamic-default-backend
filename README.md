Fed up of ugly Nginx/Openresty errors generated by your Nginx Ingress? So were we.

This can be swapped in for the normal default backend that ships with Nginx Ingress and is easy to customise.

There's some templating used in the k8s/yaml directory that is designed to be used with our tool kbuild which we use for deployments, but it should be trivial to modify if you want to use it to deploy in another way.

Currently supports text/html, application/json and application/xml. If you send it anything else in an accept header you'll just get plain text back.
